#range(4) -- 4 is a stopping number
#range(2,5) -- 2 is the starting point, 5 is the stopping number
#range(3,8,2) -- 2 is the step defining the distance between numbers 
      #notes: backward -- the number of steps will be negative
#explain:
#for i in [0,1,2,3,7]: --- is similar to -- for i in range(5) 
    #print("hi")
#for i in [0,1,2,3,44]:  
    #print(i)   --> this wil print the name of no inside []
