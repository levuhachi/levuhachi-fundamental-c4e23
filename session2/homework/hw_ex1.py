#1. What is Boolean? Write down 3 different expression that results a Boolean type (i.e. 5 == 6)
# Boolean value is either True or False.
# Boolean expression is an expression to produce Boolean value (as said above)
# For example:
    # 5 == 6 >> False
    # 9 == 3*3 >> True
    # j = "abc" and i = "def"
        # then, i + j == "abe" >> False

#2. What is the flowchart?
# The flowchart is a diagram showing the exact steps and logic of how the commands/statements execute.
#3. What is nested conditionals? Write a piece of code that uses nested conditionals
# Nested Conditionals is having more than 1 condition to produce a statement. For example:
dhm=int(input("So lan di hoc muon= "))
if dhm == 0:
    print("Good!")
else:
    if dhm < 5:
        print("Bad!")
